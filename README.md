In this repository I am trying to document all the challenges I have solved from [The Cryptopals Crypto Challenges](https://cryptopals.com/) using JavaScript. 

Quoting an important paragraph from the website to emphasize why these challenges are important:
"This is a different way to learn about crypto than taking a class or reading a book. We give you problems to solve. They're derived from weaknesses in real-world systems and modern cryptographic constructions. We give you enough info to learn about the underlying crypto concepts yourself. When you're finished, you'll not only have learned a good deal about how cryptosystems are built, but you'll also understand how they're attacked."
